      Tips: For Front-end developer, you can use
      https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ to help with accessing data from
      other websites that are normally forbidden by the same-origin policy of
      web browsers <br />
      As long as you fulfill all the user stories, you can give your personal
      touches by adding transition, using your own images, changing colors, or
      even creating your own layout,... <br />
      Remember to put your name on the footer to prevent other from submitting
      your solutions. <br />
      Once you completed, submit your solutions by providing URLs for both
      GitHub repository and live app on any hosting platform and explain briefly
      what you have done.
