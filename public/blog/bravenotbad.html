    <h1>Why Brave isn't bad</h1>

    <p>
      There is a <i>a lot</i> of misinformation being spread about
      <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>. Many people claim that it is
      spyware or harmful to your privacy. This is not true and I will debunk
      every claim I have found.
      <br />
      <br />
      DISCLAIMER: I am not affiliated with Brave in any way. I rarely even use
      it.
    </p>

    <h2>But Brave is made by an ad company!</h2>

    <p>
      An ad company that has worked hard to provide services that do not harm
      your privacy and they clearly state in their
      <a href="https://brave.com/privacy/">privacy policy</a> that their ads do
      not track you.
    </p>

    <h2>But Brave whitelists Facebook and Twitter trackers!</h2>

    <p>
      This is only partly true. Brave whitelists some Facebook and Twitter
      trackers because blocking them outright would break buttons on some
      websites (e.g. the Facebook like buttons). Brave is meant to be easy to
      use, breaking a lot of websites is not easy to use. Brave was never meant
      to be a max privacy solution. <br />
      <br />
      The whitelist is now optional and can easily be disabled in the settings.
    </p>

    <h2>But BAT tracks users!</h2>

    <p>
      No it doesn't. This is a misconception from people who have read BAT's
      <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">home page</a>. The home page
      says that the user's activites are monitored to award websites with a
      certain amount of BAT accordingly. Many people think this means Brave is
      tracking them but it does not. Anyone who has used BAT would know that the
      browser tracks the amount of time spent on each website <i>locally</i> so
      it can award websites with the right amount of BAT. The Brave devs do not
      get any information from this as it is done entirely locally. BTW, "BAT"
      is a freely convertible cryptocurrency, exchanges can be
      <a href="https://coindataflow.com/en">found here</a>.<br />
      <br />
      Even if you still dislike BAT, you can disable it. It's actually disabled
      by default. BAT is not the same as the Brave Browser.
    </p>

    <h2>But X website said it tracks us!</h2>

    <p>
      And X website is most likely full of misinformation. A common website I
      see posted around is
      <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/brave.html"
        >https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/brave.html</a
      >. Some of this website's articles are good but a lot of them are just
      wrong. The website claims that Brave is spyware. It says this because they
      whitelist some trackers (see above), they have auto-updates that cannot be
      disabled, they use Google by default, their home page contains analytics,
      they have crash reports and make some other requests.
      <br />
      <br />
      Auto-updates are not directly anti-privacy. There is no proof that the
      Brave team are using this to track you. It cannot be disabled because they
      are important for security. <br />
      <br />
      Brave uses Google by default because it is meant to be easy to use. Using
      search engines others may not be familiar with or ones that give worse
      results will not be easy to use. Again, Brave is not meant to be a maximum
      privacy solution. <br />
      <br />
      Their home page (their website, not the browser's home page) contains
      analytics because they want to see what type of users are using their
      service, how many etc. Analytics are used virtually everywhere and are a
      nice way to gain information about how much traffic your website is
      recieving. Additionally, Brave's tracker blocker blocks this tracker
      anyway. <br />
      <br />
      Crash reports are also not anti-privacy. They are commonly used to help
      diagnose errors and fix them. They can easily be disabled if needed.
      <br />
      <br />
      The other requests part is complete nonsense. I have monitored the
      requests Brave makes and they are very little (only auto-updates). The
      other requests they mentioned have never appeared. See the photo below for
      what requests actually happen. <br />
      <br />

        width="1000"
        alt="Brave Requests"
      />
    </p>

    <h2>But Brave is based on Chromium!</h2>

    <p>
      Chromium is open source and all Google tracking can easily be disabled.
      Brave strips out all of this by default. Remember that Chromium is not the
      same as Chrome.
    </p>

    <h2>But the lead Brave developer created JavaScript!</h2>

    <p>
      JavaScript is used for many purposes and was not created solely to track
      you. Brendan Eich did not create it for it to be used as a potential
      tracking tool.
    </p>

    <h2>But Brave has a backdoor!</h2>

    <p>
      No it doesn't. Brave is open source and there has been no backdoor ever
      found. Many people claim that Brave being able to use custom HTTP headers
      are a backdoor but this isn't true. HTTP headers are allowed as per
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5">RFC 7231</a>. See
      Brendan Eich's
      <a
